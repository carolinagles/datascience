# Age Estimation Using Computer Vision

## Project Description

Good Seed supermarket chain would like to explore how data science can help ensure compliance with alcohol laws by preventing the sale of alcohol to minors. You are tasked with evaluating whether it is possible to use computer vision to verify the age of individuals and confirm whether they are underage when purchasing alcohol.

The stores are equipped with cameras in the checkout area, which are activated when a person is purchasing alcohol. Computer vision methods can be used to estimate a personâ€™s age from a photo.

Your task is to build and evaluate a model to verify the age of individuals.

## Project Instructions

1. **Complete the questionnaire** to verify your understanding of the project description.
2. **Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to get a general overview of the dataset.
3. **Train and evaluate the model** (this must be done on the GPU platform).
4. **Combine your code, outputs, and findings** from the steps above into a final Jupyter notebook.
5. **Make conclusions** from the model evaluation and include them in the notebook.
6. The final notebook will be reviewed by the project reviewers.
