    "**This project** focuses on identifying the best locations to open new oil wells in three regions using synthetic geological data and a linear regression model. The main goal is to maximize profits and minimize risks, ensuring the economic sustainability of the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main steps to be taken are the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read** the files with the oil well parameters: `crude oil quality` and `reserve volume`.\n",
    "2. **Create** a model to predict the `reserve volume` in new wells.\n",
    "3. **Select** the wells with the highest estimated values.\n",
    "4. **Identify** the region with the highest total profit for the selected wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential benefits and risks are analyzed using the **bootstrapping** technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following are the conditions for the project:**\n",
    "  - Only linear regression should be used for model training.\n",
    "  - When exploring the region, a study of 500 points is carried out, with the selection of the best 200 points for calculating the profit.\n",
    "  - The budget for developing 200 oil wells is **100 million dollars**.\n",
    "  - A barrel of raw materials generates **4.5 USD** in revenue. The revenue from a product unit is **4500 dollars** (the reserve volume is expressed in thousands of barrels).\n",
    "  - After risk evaluation:\n",
    "    - Keep only the regions with a loss risk of less than **2.5%**.\n",
    "    - From those that meet the criteria, select the region with the highest average profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The datasets for the three regions contain the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`id`**: Unique well identifier.\n",
    "- **`f0`, `f1`, `f2`**: Characteristics of the exploration points.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Geo 1 should be selected for the development of the 200 wells based on the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Highest Profit**: Geo 1, despite having a slightly lower overall profit compared to Geo 0, offers the highest average profit of **$4,467,968.61** in the bootstrapping simulations. This suggests more consistent profitability when considering the uncertainty introduced by the bootstrapping method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lower Risk of Loss**: Geo 1 has the **lowest risk of loss** (1.30%) among all regions. This is an important factor in minimizing the likelihood of a negative return, which can be especially crucial in high-stakes investments like oil well development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence Interval**: The 95% confidence interval for Geo 1 is the narrowest, ranging from **$424,025.31 to $8,559,670.19**, indicating less variability in profit outcomes compared to Geo 0 and Geo 2. A narrower confidence interval suggests more reliable and predictable results for the investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Target Reserve Volume**: Geo 1 has a **target oil reserve volume of 27,589.08 thousand barrels**, which is competitive and close to Geo 2's target. This volume provides substantial reserves, making it a strong candidate for profit generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consistent Results**: The fact that Geo 1 remains profitable across simulations, with a high average profit and relatively low risk, makes it a more dependable choice for future well development compared to the other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Geo 1 stands out as the most reliable and profitable region for well development due to its combination of higher average profit, lower risk of loss, and more stable confidence intervals."
