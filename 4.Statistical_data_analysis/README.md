# Megaline Telecom Plan Analysis - Statistical Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was designed to analyze the profitability of Megaline’s prepaid telecom plans: **Surf** and **Ultimate**. The analysis aims to determine which plan generates more revenue by examining the usage patterns of 500 customers. Data collected includes customer demographics, usage statistics (calls, messages, internet sessions), and monthly charges for both plans. Statistical tests were conducted to compare the average income generated by each plan and to evaluate if regional differences exist in user spending patterns.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, compare revenue generation across two telecom plans (Surf and Ultimate), and assess if there are significant differences in user income by region. The project involves data preprocessing, statistical hypothesis testing, and data visualization.

## Data Sources

The following datasets were used for analysis:

- **megaline_calls.csv**: Contains information on calls made by users (date, duration, user_id).
- **megaline_internet.csv**: Contains data on internet sessions (data usage, session date, user_id).
- **megaline_messages.csv**: Contains data on SMS sent by users (message date, user_id).
- **megaline_plans.csv**: Contains the details of the prepaid plans offered by Megaline (plan name, monthly fee, included minutes, SMS, data, and charges for exceeding limits).
- **megaline_users.csv**: Contains demographic information on users (user_id, name, age, city, subscription date, plan name).

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Data Exploration

The raw data was loaded, and an initial exploration of the datasets was performed to understand the structure and types of the data. The following was done:

- The data types for each column were verified and corrected as needed.
- Missing values were identified and handled.
- Duplicates were removed.
- The consistency and accuracy of the data were checked.

### Step 2: Data Preparation

The data was cleaned and transformed for analysis. Key steps included:

- **Data Conversion**: The necessary columns were converted into the appropriate data types (e.g., converting `call_date` to datetime).
- **Error Handling**: Errors in data (such as incorrect call durations or messages) were found and corrected by filtering out or adjusting incorrect entries.
- **Monthly Calculations**: For each user, the number of calls, messages, and internet usage for each month were calculated. Additionally, the total revenue generated per user was calculated by:
  - Subtracting the free plan limits from the total usage.
  - Multiplying the excess usage by the respective per-unit charge.
  - Adding the monthly plan fee based on the user’s plan.

### Step 3: Data Analysis

Once the data was prepared, the following analyses were conducted:

- **Monthly Usage**: The total number of minutes, messages, and data usage per user per month was calculated for both plans.
- **Revenue Calculation**: The monthly revenue per user was computed based on the usage data and plan fees.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: The mean, variance, and standard deviation of usage and revenue were calculated to understand the distribution of customer activity.
- **Data Visualizations**: Histograms were plotted to visualize the distribution of usage data for each plan.

### Step 4: Hypothesis Testing

Two hypotheses were tested using statistical methods:

1. **Hypothesis 1**: The average income of users in the Ultimate plan differs from that of users in the Surf plan.
   - The null hypothesis (H0) stated that there is no difference in the average income between the two plans.
   - The alternative hypothesis (H1) stated that there is a significant difference in the average income between the two plans.

2. **Hypothesis 2**: The average income of users in the New York-New Jersey area differs from that of users in other regions.
   - The null hypothesis (H0) stated that there is no difference in income between the two regions.
   - The alternative hypothesis (H1) stated that there is a significant difference in income between the two regions.

These hypotheses were tested using an appropriate alpha level, and the results were used to draw conclusions.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, conclusions were drawn regarding the profitability of the two plans. The following was concluded:

- **Revenue Generation**: The plan that generated the most revenue was determined, and recommendations were made based on these findings.
- **Regional Differences**: Differences in average revenue by region were evaluated to identify any trends.



## Libraries used 

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and documentation
- Hypothesis testing (T-tests)


## Future Work

- Further segmentation of users could help identify specific behaviors contributing to higher revenue.
- A larger dataset could provide more robust insights and reduce biases in the findings.
