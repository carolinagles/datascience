# Exploring Music Streaming Trends - Python II

User preferences and activity trends in two cities, Springfield and Shelbyville, are investigated in this project using real-world music streaming data. By analyzing this data, a hypothesis about differences in user activity based on the day of the week and city of residence is tested.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main stages, each with specific objectives:

1. **Stage 1: Data Overview**  
   - Provide a general description of the dataset.  
   - Record initial observations based on a preliminary exploration of the data.

2. **Stage 2: Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean the dataset by addressing column inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values.  
   - Prepare the data for further analysis.

3. **Stage 3: Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Test the hypothesis:
     > "User activity varies based on the day of the week and the city."  
   - Use programming techniques to validate or refute the hypothesis and comment on the results.

By completing these stages, meaningful insights will be extracted from the data, and data-driven conclusions will be made.


### Dataset Description

Stored in the file `/music_project_en.csv`.  

#### Columns: 
- **`userID`**: Unique identifier for each user.  
- **`Track`**: Title of the song.  
- **`artist`**: Name of the artist.  
- **`genre`**: Musical genre.  
- **`City`**: User's city (Springfield or Shelbyville).  
- **`time`**: Time the track was played (HH:MM:SS).  
- **`Day`**: Day of the week.




## Insights and Outcomes

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and analytical storytelling. By the end, a deeper understanding of how user activity in music streaming varies across different cities and timeframes will be gained.
